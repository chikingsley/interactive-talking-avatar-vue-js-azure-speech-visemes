# Interactive Talking Avatar üó£Ô∏è

Talking Avatar is an interactive, animated avatar that responds in real-time by overlaying SVG
viseme images on a static image, synced with audio generated via the Azure Speech TTS service. The
responses are powered by OpenAI, making the avatar both responsive and intelligent. By subscribing
to the visemes event from Azure Speech, the avatar's mouth movements are coordinated with speech,
creating a natural talking effect.
